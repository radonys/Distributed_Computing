Distributed Computing - Research Work Implementations

Requirements:

1. Python 2.7

How to Execute:

1. Dijkstra 1974

	a) For algorithm 1.py, where states K is greater than machines N, both the inputs should be given as command line arguments. For example,

		"python 1.py 3 4"

	   where 3 is the number of machines and 4 states.

	b) For algortihms 2.py and 3.py, only number of machines N needs to be given. For example,

		"python [2/3].py 3"

		where 3 is the number of machines.

2. Dijkstra 1986

	It has only one algorithm 1.py, and the needs to be executed in the following format:

		"python 1.py 3"

		where 3 is the number of machines.
